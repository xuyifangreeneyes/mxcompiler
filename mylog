VariableDecl and FunctionDecl in class need to check whether it has the same name with class name.
The bug needs fixing.

int a = new int; bool b = new bool; string c = new string; 
These are illegal but have not been checked.

Now calling append after BB is ended will do nothing.

when dealing with assign in ir, calculate lhs's address first and then calculate rhs's value, which can 
save a pair of store and load if rhs is logicOpExpr. Not sure in this way whether there is any side effect.
